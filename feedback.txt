We felt that this project was enjoyable, but also extremely time-consuming. Especially apparent with the first
two questions, we felt that figuring out even trivial things took a long time due to poor documentation and
the lack of resources on Piazza. Parts 3 and 4 were very interesting, and I felt that while they were difficult,
the final product was something we could be proud of. Overall, I feel that to improve this project, the staff
should provide a conglomerate post with all the necessary common commands, as well as some links that could help
with understanding the documentation of the APIs used in the project.
